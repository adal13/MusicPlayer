# MusicPlayer

A Music Player Built for music Lover :)

I wanted to understand how does music player works and what kind of difficulties need to face during creating such application .
Tried to implemnent most basic functionality like List of avaiabable music on phone and can make list of your all favourite music as well . 
apart from this two functionality you can shuffle the song and can play into loop by your choice . 

Most difficult part was to create notification and bind with activity with help of BroadCast and Service but i finally figure it out .
